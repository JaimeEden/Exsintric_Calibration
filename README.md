# Exsintric_Calibration
This repository implements an extrinsic calibration algorithm that utilizes batch-collected pose data from two coordinate frames. The method demonstrates high accuracy in rotation estimation, making it suitable for applications requiring precise alignment between sensor frames or coordinate systems.
